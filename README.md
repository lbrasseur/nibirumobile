Nibiru Mobile is a framework for developing portable mobile applications created at Oxen.

You can use it in order to create portable HTML-based (GWT) application and/or native Android/iOS applications reusing most of the code.

It provides:
 * A common API for components typically used on mobile development.
 * Implementations of these APIs for GWT, Android and iOS.

It was built with the same philosophy used in [Nibiru Framework](https://github.com/lbrasseur/nibiru): creating a common API and structure for typical projects. But it is a completely different framework.

The components are based on JSR330 dependency injection, but implementations are based on many technologies, such as:

 * [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) platform: [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org), [GIN](http://code.google.com/p/google-gin/), [Apache Cordova](http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/), [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/), [persistence.js](http://persistencejs.org/), [MGWT](http://www.m-gwt.com/).
 * [Android](https://www.android.com/) platform: [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/), [RoboGuice](http://code.google.com/p/roboguice/), [OrmLite](http://ormlite.com/).
 * [iOS](http://www.apple.com/ios) platform: [RoboVM](http://robovm.com/).
 * [Windows Phone](https://www.windowsphone.com) platform: [WinJS](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop/winjs).
 * [Firefox OS](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os) platform: [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org).


just to name the main ones.

Look at the [Getting Started](https://github.com/lbrasseur/nibirumobile/wiki/GettingStarted) section for a quick start. Also check the [brainstorming](https://github.com/lbrasseur/nibirumobile/wiki/Brainstorming) section for ideas about the future of the framework.

Believe it or not, there are [people using](https://github.com/lbrasseur/nibirumobile/wiki/WhoIsUsingThis) this framework!

The API is still unstable. Wer'e working on many improvements, as you can see on the [releases page](https://github.com/lbrasseur/nibirumobile/wiki/Releases).
